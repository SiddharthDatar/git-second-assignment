In this github, I will manipulate the mission statement of a amazon.com
I will first have the initial statement on the main branch. Then, I will create a new "testing" branch", where I will continually edit the statement, and continually push my changes to the testing branch. Then, I will merge this new statement and my original statement and choose which I prefer.
